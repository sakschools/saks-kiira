Match Day 2 of the 2025 Kampala Junior League brought with it a fresh wave of excitement, challenge, and opportunity for Sir Apollo Kaggwa Primary School Kira. Our boys’, girls’, and junior football teams stepped onto the pitch with determination, representing the school with pride, heart, and an eagerness to improve. While victories remained just out of reach, the experience gained, goals scored, and teamwork displayed highlighted a growing resilience and promising potential within our squads.

## Boys’ Football

Match Day 2 brought contrasting experiences for our boys’ football team. They faced a tough outing against Mugongo, resulting in a 0-6 defeat, but responded with improved energy and purpose against Kyengera, where they scored three goals in a thrilling 3-5 contest. Goal scorers Samuel Kajomba, Bukenya, Aaron, and Masuudi provided the spark in attack, and though the match ended in defeat, the attacking display marked a turning point in the team’s campaign.

Reflecting on Match Day 1, Kanyike Jayron netted Kira’s first goal in a 1-3 loss to Sir Apollo Kaggwa Boarding School Old Kampala, while the team also suffered a narrow 0-1 loss to Sir Apollo Kaggwa Primary School Mengo. After four matches, the boys’ football team holds 0 wins, 0 draws, and 4 losses, with 5 goals scored and 15 conceded. Despite the results, their attacking rhythm and resilience continue to grow, pointing to a brighter road ahead.

## Girls’ Football

The girls’ team showed strong character on Match Day 2. A well-earned 0-0 draw with Mugongo highlighted their solid defensive shape and teamwork. In their second fixture, they faced a high-pressing Kyengera side and fell 0-2, despite a disciplined performance. Combined with their Match Day 1 efforts, a narrow 0-1 loss to Sir Apollo Kaggwa Boarding School Old Kampala and a 0-0 draw with Mengo, the girls have completed four games with 2 draws and 2 losses, 0 goals scored, and only 3 goals conceded.

## The Kira Spirit Shines Through

Though Match Day 2 did not deliver wins, it revealed the deeper strength of our teams—the ability to grow through every challenge, to fight for every ball, and to wear the school colours with honour. From Jayron’s opening goal, to the junior scorers’ brave debut and the girls’ resolute defending, our pupils are writing a story of resilience and progress.

As we prepare for Match Day 3, our focus remains on continued development, unity, and believing in what we can become. With the support of our dedicated coaches, teachers, parents, and the entire school community, we move forward with confidence.

Our journey continues as we travel to Sir Apollo Kaggwa Primary School Kisaasi for Match Day 3 of the Kampala Junior League. There, our teams will take on the hosts, Sir Apollo Kaggwa Primary School Kisaasi, and Fairways Nursery and Primary School Kireka.

With renewed determination and valuable lessons from previous fixtures, our boys’, girls’, and junior teams are ready to showcase their spirit, unity, and growth once again. We encourage the entire school community to continue rallying behind our pupils as they carry the Kira banner forward.
